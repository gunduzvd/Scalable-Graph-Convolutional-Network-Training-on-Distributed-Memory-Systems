Scalable Graph Convolutional Network Training on Distributed-Memory Systems

The code requires SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS (https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/GraphBLAS) and MPI libraries. Modify INC_DIR and LIB_DIR variables in the makefile to point correct locations.

To compile the code just run the command:

make

To run the executable:

mpirun -n {PATH_TO_PARTS} -c {NTHREADS}

Variables {PATH_TO_CONFIG} must store the path to the directory storing partitioned input matrices and the path to the configuration file, respectively. Directory and configuratin file are generated by the partitioning code.
