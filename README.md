# Scalable Graph Convolutional Network Training on Distributed-Memory Systems

The code requires SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS (https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/GraphBLAS) and MPI libraries. Modify INC_DIR and LIB_DIR variables in the makefile to point correct locations.

To compile the code just run the command:

make

To run the executable:

mpirun -n {PATH_TO_PARTS} -c {NTHREADS}

Variables {PATH_TO_CONFIG} must store the path to the directory storing partitioned input matrices and the path to the configuration file, respectively. Directory and configuratin file are generated by the partitioning code.


# ParallelGCNHypergraphPartitioning 

The input matrix partitioning code for parallel GCN training algorithm. The code uses patoh hypergraph partitioning library.
Modify INC_DIR and LIB_DIR to point appropriate locations for patoh library.

To compile the partitioning code just use the command:

make

To run the executable run:

./gcnhgp -a {Par_A} -h {Par_H} -o {Par_O} -k {k} -f {nfeatures} -l {nlayers}

-a {Par_A} : path to adjacecny matrix
-h {Par_H} : path to input vertex features
-o {Par_O} : output folder for partitioned matrices
-k {k} : Number of partitions
-f {nfeatures} : number of features per layer
-l {nlayers} : number of layers
